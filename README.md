This repository is a small project for my interview for Fetch. It very simply pulls some data and displays it in a RecyclerView. It uses MVVM architecture, Hilt/Dagger, Room, Coroutines.

Further work:
Add tests
Consider adding animation
Conform UI to Material Design standards
Add manual refresh option
Add better handling for network state, including better handling of initial load when offline
Consider Flows instead of suspend functions
Get colors from theme
